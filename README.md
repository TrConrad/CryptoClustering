# CryptoClustering

This challenge was an exercise in utilizing unsupervised machine learning to analyze, group, and classify data. The Crypto Currency data that was utilized in this challenge was scaled utilizing StandardScaler, and Elbow Eurves and K-means were both employed to determine the optimal number of clusters to divide the data into. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of Crypto Currency data. From there, Elbow Curves and K-means were used on the newly reduced data to determine if the optimal number of clusters had been altered. The original scaled data's optimal number of clusters was 4, while the PCA data had an optimal cluster number of 2. The clustering of the data had also changed with the utilization of PCA, with all but one singular outlier being combined into one cluster, and the lone outlier being the second in the PCA data. The original data had two seperate outliers that made up their respective individual, while the majority of the datapoints were split into another two clusters, making up a total of four data points.
